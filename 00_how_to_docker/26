#Launch a 42school/engineering-bay service in two replicas and make sure that
#the service works properly. This service will be named engineering-bay and
#will be on the overmind network.

docker service create -d --name engineering-bay --env OC_USERNAME=user --env OC_PASSWD=password --network overmind --replicas 2 42school/engineering-bay

#Same approach as problem 24, and also use the docker service ls to check
